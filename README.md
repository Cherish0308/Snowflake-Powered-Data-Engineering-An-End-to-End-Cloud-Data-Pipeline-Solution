## Architecture
The architecture consists of:
1. **Data Extraction**: APIs are used to extract data.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested into the **Snowflake Cloud Platform**.
3. **Data Transformation**: The data is transformed and modeled using a **star schema** design.
4. **Data Visualization**: Final insights are visualized using **Streamlit**.

## Technologies
- **Snowflake Cloud Data Platform**: Data storage and processing.
- **Streamlit**: For data visualization.
- **GitHub Actions**: For workflow automation.
- **API Integration**: For data extraction.
- **Star Schema Design**: Used for data modeling.
